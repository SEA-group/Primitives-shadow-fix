Written and tested in Matlab R2018b

## How to use
1. Put `PrimitivesReader_Mk5_SE.m` and `ShadowFix_Mk1.m` beside your mods
2. Toggle line 9 in `ShadowFix_Mk1.m` if you want to keep original primitives files.
3. Run `ShadowFix_Mk1.m`. It will process all primitives files in the subfolders. 
4. Convert primitives to geometry with WG's tool.
